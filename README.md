# requests.rb

An attempt to port Kenneth Reitz's excellent python module [requests][1] to 
Ruby (or at least the API).

## Supported Versions

As of now, I can only confirm that this works on ruby 1.9.3. I will be adding
tests shortly so that it can be tested with Travis against other versions as
requested.
